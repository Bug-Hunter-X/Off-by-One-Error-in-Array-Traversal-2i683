# Off-by-One Error in Java Array

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an index beyond the valid range of the array, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution shows how to correctly iterate over the array using a less than operator to prevent this error.
